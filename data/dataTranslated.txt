That starts with "cheaper" and fairer information. Everything we do is centered on being fair, fast, and fun. Be began by fighting voter apathy in 2020.

Since the 2020 election, we’ve been designing a tool to fight the political corruption created by large corporate donations and lobbying. We are super excited to announce that after months of development and thousands of hours of research, our new Chrome extension that matches shoppers to the companies that donate to candidates that share their political values has been approved and is live in the Google Chrome Store!!! Who We Are Our team is made up of passionate people from all over the world, from all walks of life, and from all over the political spectrum.

VotingSmarter’s new Chrome extension turns countless hours of research into a tool for conscious consumerism. The businesses you shop at everyday use YOUR dollars to support THEIR values and political agendas. With the VotingSmarter browser extension, you can be sure your dollars are spent supporting YOUR values.

And that brings us to you… or rather you to us. Pushing boundaries of traditional marketing requires a curious mind undeterred by the never been done. You are a tinkerer, someone who likes to take things apart to figure out how they work, and then put them back together to work even better. You do not mind working on small-ish teams, and you have been known as “the problem-solver” in the group who figures out how to get things done. If that sounds like you, read on! About Us Cheil Worldwide is the 11th-largest creative agency in the world. Headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, we were founded by Samsung in 1973 to grow its local and global business. While Samsung is still one of our main clients, our roster has evolved to include other globally recognized brands such as Adidas, PayPal, ESPN, Lego, Coca-Cola, Nivea, Starbucks and many more. Cheil Dallas serves as the lead agency for all Samsung projects in North America and is located steps from their office at Legacy Central in Plano, Texas. It’s the home base for more than 170 creative problem-solvers who share a passion for developing groundbreaking ideas rooted in data, driven by insights, and enabled by innovative technology. About You Who you are is just as important as (if not more important than!) what you can do. You have experience with software development, most likely in languages like Python, C++, Go (golang), or something along those lines. You can set up a project in GitHub, manage a README markdown file, and put triggers in place for automatically deploying branches to specific staging/production environments in your sleep. You are a proactive leader and problem solver. You’re naturally curious and strive to learn. You’re a good colleague who cares about the well-being of your team members. You work well on inter-team collaboration with product managers, software developers, data analysts, and account services. You probably make comments at happy hour like, “DevOps is more than just a sys admin who talks to devs,” or, “Here are ten reasons why I’ll take z-shell over bash,” or possibly even, “Isn’t it weird that depending on what branch of Amazon you work for, ‘continuous delivery’ can mean two completely different things?” If you go quiet on Slack, it’s probably because you are setting up automated unit tests with GitHub actions. About The Role Like you, this job is multidimensional. And every aspect is crucial to creating culturally relevant work. Collaborate with team leadership to understand project requirements and plan the best way to exceed them. Work with developers to create, manage, optimize, and integrate their development and deployment workflows. Troubleshoot operation issues across multiple projects. Develop solutions that can support large capacity and scale reliability Create and monitor the CI/CD pipeline and respond to incidents. Document everything.

About The Requirements You’ve got to check the boxes before you can think outside of them. Bachelor’s degree in a related field preferred. 3+ years’ professional experience with development infrastructure. Skilled in AWS or similar package services. Experience with GitHub/GitLab/Jenkins/Jira/Confluence, or similar services. Networking experience. Ability to: quickly understand, simplify, internalize, and communicate complex digital concepts.

As innovation and the field of research & development were close to my heart, this year I had the opportunity to work 40% internally on innovative and exciting subjects by integrating the Tech Office. I therefore carry out two activities in parallel, namely my mission with the client (GRDF?) and my activities for the Tech Office. What are your missions at Avanade? As mentioned previously, I carry out two activities jointly: At my client, I developed a chatbot integrated in Teams, using Microsofts Bot Framework SDK. The primary objective of the bot is to answer employees questions on internal tools and services, and on the tools of the Office 365 suite, as part of change management within the company. I am currently working on making it more “intelligent” by incorporating cognitive language understanding capabilities – AI – so that it can handle multiple scenarios. Within the Tech Office, I had the opportunity to work on different projects and explore many innovative topics. I started by working on a demonstrator centered around industrial IoT and intended for a trade show in which Avanade participates, called SIDO. The project includes different technologies such as "AI at Edge", IoT, digital twin, mixed and virtual reality, robotics, low-code, data processing, etc. I also helped design the Innovation Center in the Paris offices, thinking about the offer for Avanade customers and employees, its format (the "Innovation Journey") and its content (the demos , presentations etc). I then explored the subject of the "Metaverse" by working on the design and 3D modeling of virtual universes, to finally focus on extended reality technologies (AR, MR and VR) as well as project management. and team. What do you like about your missions? What I like the most is their diversity, I like to discover a new subject or a new technology. I also appreciate the freedom and autonomy I have to carry out my research and develop my applications. And obviously, all these experiences are very enriching both technically and interpersonally. What do you like about Avanade? Having the opportunity to train and improve your skills whatever your level is a real plus. I was also touched by the benevolence and mutual support between the employees. How did you discover Avanade? What made you choose Avanade? I discovered Avanade through a friend from my engineering school, who was already on a permanent contract when I was looking for a company to do my end-of-studies internship. What made me choose Avanade is the training opportunity, as well as the missions that I was presented with and on which I was going to be able to intervene. What were your missions during the internship? During this period I also worked on two subjects in parallel, the first was the development of a dual mobile and desktop application using the PowerPlatform (low-code/no-code technology), intended to facilitate the integration and assimilation of the knowledge acquired by the new joiners during their onboarding, and taking the form of a game in several parts. During this project I went through all the stages of the life cycle of a project, namely, the analysis and collection of needs, the POC, the costing, the writing of a backlog and the implementation of an Agile methodology, the development, the tests, the production and the writing of a documentation. The second project was the development of an AI as part of an application to learn sign language in mixed reality with a HoloLens 2 headset. For this innovative project, I alternated between development and research phases /reading scientific papers. Still have doubts?

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers workflows. Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback. You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game.

We solve many of the industrys most critical and complex technical challenges, providing solutions for more efficient broadband networks and a richer multimedia experience years ahead of market deployment. InterDigital has strategic relationships with many of the worlds leading wireless companies. Founded in 1972, InterDigital is listed on NASDAQ and is included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. PhD topic: Deep interactive control of virtual characters motion based on separating identity, motion and style Competencies computer animation, deep learning Description Character animation has a large set of potential applications, in videogames, movie industry, sports, rehabilitation, ergonomics, training, etc. Most of the available tools to animate virtual humans consist in specifying angular trajectories for each joint of a skeleton. The surface mesh of the character is then computed accordingly, using so-called skinning algorithms. However, being able to capture and reproduce the expressivity of a human motion is difficult, as it involves several subtle parameters, some of them being lost when modeling human performance as joint angles: angles, contacts on the body surface, velocity profiles, accelerations, distance or coordination between body parts, etc. With the development of robust body shape reconstruction based on cheap sensors, such as RGB cameras or depth sensors,directly manipulating the visible surface of the character has become a very active field of research. With the growing interest in persistent shared virtual worlds, such as the MetaVerse immersive social network, specific problems for character animation raised. Indeed, in these environments, the users are represented by avatars with different shape and morphology. The character animation platform should consequently be able to adapt the motion of the user to this different shape (retargetting problem), or adapt the identity of the avatar to make the user be recognizable by his/her friends, or change the style of the motion to convey a given emotion or adapt to the expecting behavior of the avatar. For example, a Hulk avatar is expecting to move with a specific style, but should also mimic the performance of the user. This PhD topic will investigate deep-learning methods to solve this retargeting problem while controlling the style.

Testimony of a) former) intern Hello ! My name is Zoé, I have been working at Avanade for almost a year and a half now. I started as an intern at the Digital Factory on March 1, 2021, as part of my end-of-studies internship and continued on a permanent contract. As innovation and the field of research & development were close to my heart, this year I had the opportunity to work 40% internally on innovative and exciting subjects by integrating the Tech Office. I therefore carry out two activities in parallel, namely my mission with the client (GRDF?) and my activities for the Tech Office. What are your missions at Avanade? As mentioned previously, I carry out two activities jointly: At my client, I developed a chatbot integrated in Teams, using Microsofts Bot Framework SDK. The primary objective of the bot is to answer employees questions on internal tools and services, and on the tools of the Office 365 suite, as part of change management within the company. I am currently working on making it more “intelligent” by incorporating cognitive language understanding capabilities – AI – so that it can handle multiple scenarios. Within the Tech Office, I had the opportunity to work on different projects and explore many innovative topics. I started by working on a demonstrator centered around industrial IoT and intended for a trade show in which Avanade participates, called SIDO. The project includes different technologies such as "AI at Edge", IoT, digital twin, mixed and virtual reality, robotics, low-code, data processing, etc. I also helped design the Innovation Center in the Paris offices, thinking about the offer for Avanade customers and employees, its format (the "Innovation Journey") and its content (the demos , presentations etc). I then explored the subject of the "Metaverse" by working on the design and 3D modeling of virtual universes, to finally focus on extended reality technologies (AR, MR and VR) as well as project management. and team. What do you like about your missions? What I like the most is their diversity, I like to discover a new subject or a new technology. I also appreciate the freedom and autonomy I have to carry out my research and develop my applications. And obviously, all these experiences are very enriching both technically and interpersonally. What do you like about Avanade? Having the opportunity to train and improve your skills whatever your level is a real plus. I was also touched by the benevolence and mutual support between the employees. How did you discover Avanade? What made you choose Avanade? I discovered Avanade through a friend from my engineering school, who was already on a permanent contract when I was looking for a company to do my end-of-studies internship. What made me choose Avanade is the training opportunity, as well as the missions that I was presented with and on which I was going to be able to intervene. What were your missions during the internship? During this period I also worked on two subjects in parallel, the first was the development of a dual mobile and desktop application using the PowerPlatform (low-code/no-code technology), intended to facilitate the integration and assimilation of the knowledge acquired by the new joiners during their onboarding, and taking the form of a game in several parts. During this project I went through all the stages of the life cycle of a project, namely, the analysis and collection of needs, the POC, the costing, the writing of a backlog and the implementation of an Agile methodology, the development, the tests, the production and the writing of a documentation. The second project was the development of an AI as part of an application to learn sign language in mixed reality with a HoloLens 2 headset. For this innovative project, I alternated between development and research phases /reading scientific papers. Still have doubts?

Some exemplary projects we are engaged in are: Hybrid proof systems from SNARKs and STARKs. In this project, we combine techniques from SNARKs and STARKs to build hybrid proof systems enjoying the bests of both worlds. SNARKs allow for short (constant-size) proofs and have efficient verifiers, on the other had, they require trusted setup. zkSTARKs are transparent (dont rely on a trusted setup) and have efficient prover while paying the price of longer proof size (logarithmic to the size of the proven statement) and verifiers complexity. We investigate use of STARK-related primitives like FRI to give zkSNARKs more efficient provers and reduce security assumptions used. In the nearest future we plan to implement our hybrid schemes to show the world concrete efficiency gains our approach brings. Secure storage for mnemonic keys. The common problem of using secret keys is that they may be stolen or lost, causing for example, losing access to staked funds. Here, we build an application that allows users to securely distribute the key into so-called shares such that only large enough set of the shares can be used to reconstruct the secret and someone who knows too few secrets shares learns nothing. We achieve that by using Shamirs secret sharing scheme. Importantly both the secret and the shares are represented by easy to remember mnemonic. Security analysis of proof systems. In this project, we analyse security properties of existing zkSNARKs to verify whether they are sufficiently secure for such a complex environments that blockchains are. To that end, we use provable security methods. Additionally, we analyse existing zkSNARKs and name their security gaps. We show where efficiency-oriented efforts make proof systems unusable due to security vulnerabilities. Towards more efficient and secure polynomial commitments. Polynomial commitment schemes are going to lay the ground for Ethereums data availability in the future. Hence, one of our research task is to investigate novel polynomial commitment schemes that are better than Kate et al commitment scheme in terms of security and efficiency. Towards more fair MEV. On of the potential security measure one can take to mitigate malicious MEV extraction attacks is by obfuscating submitted transactions. In this project, we investigate use of privacy preserving tools to assure more fair MEV. Our team is looking for two kinds of people: Cryptography enthusiasts who would enjoy analysing, breaking and designing cryptographic schemes. Engineers with some background in cryptography who enjoy making proof of concepts of novel cryptographic protocols, extending cryptographic libraries, and finding vulnerabilities in existing implementations. Skills that you will use and learn at the Nineveh research team include but not limited to: basic algebra cryptography -- provable security, cryptographic protocols (esp. zero-knowledge ones) MEV distributed systems C++ / Rust / Python Heres what some of our current interns have to say: "Im super excited with this opportunity to take part in such an important project and to work with a team of really talented people.

Matrix’s mission is to make messaging as open as email — allowing everyone to choose where their data is hosted, enjoy private conversations thanks to advanced encryption, and ultimately be in control of their own communication. Matrix powers Element, our flagship messaging apps for the web, iOS & Android, along with Element Matrix Services (EMS), our SaaS platform for personal & professional use. We build things for everyone, and we know we can’t succeed without a diverse team. Our hiring process is designed to be humane and give candidates the best chance to show us what you can do. If we ever fall down on this, please let us know. The Role Element is heavily investing in building out Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC: providing an open and decentralised E2EE transport for negotiating media streams and data channels. On top, we have recently extended Matrix to support scalable decentralised E2EE group voice and video calling too (MSC3401). These are the base building blocks for visionary applications such as Element Call as well as the open metaverse (aka third room). Similar to the concept of bridges between matrix and classical messenger applications, we are also aiming for bridging real-time media applications to connect to more legacy systems, e.g., SIP / PSTN, as we are trying to work on interoperability with a unified collaboration & communication vision. The VoIP team will be responsible for designing and implementing a Matrix MSC3401 compatible backend including a generic bridging model. Currently Element Call cannot interop with other VoIP platforms. You’d come along to help evolve the backend and add one of the first bridges to interop with, e.g., SIP / PSTN, using a modern tech stack that ensures future compatibility. Our VoIP team ensures that there is a communication layer for an open metaverse, so this is a great chance to make a big impact on the future of communication. Since (almost) everything we do is open source you can get a great feel for exactly what it would be like to work on the team, come and say hi! Requirements As part of our VoIP Team you are fascinated by real-time audio and video processing. You enjoy exciting challenges and work scientifically on cutting-edge technologies. You will be responsible for developing audio / video infrastructure components and services. Your ideas and work will improve our real-time communication platform which is used by several million users per day. The most important thing is that you believe passionately in the mission of decentralisation of the internet. More specifically that you believe that communications should not be centralised in the hands of a small number of very large organisations and instead individuals should control their own data and choose who they share it with. Additionally we are looking for someone who is: Smart, curious and enthusiastic Likes to ship early and often Likes to write tests :) A tireless advocate of code quality (understanding the need for trade-offs in the short term whilst keeping us honest in the long term) Enjoys working in an Agile / Lean development environment Is articulate and empathetic. Your experience We don’t have hard requirements, we just want to build the best possible team, but as a bonus it would be great if some of the following are true. Knowledge in real-time streaming of live-media (WebRTC) Experience in legacy VoIP protocols like SIP Knowledge of Linux, Docker Experience maintaining and / or contributing to open source projects Experience working in a continuous delivery environment Ideally you worked with Go or Rust already If you have any questions before making an application reach out to Adam (adamt@element.io). Benefits People tend to stay with the company for a long time, we take this as a sign that we have a cohesive, supportive culture, that we have engaging challenging work and that people can develop their skills and careers here for the long term. We also have a family friendly environment, many of the team have small children and we look to accommodate that as best we can. Since our technology is relevant to anything that requires real-time comms, the role provides exposure to a wide range of domains from web and app dev through to VR, VoIP and IoT. Our package generally contains: Private Health Insurance Pension Annual Bonus Share Options Home Office Allowance Coworking Space Allowance Annual leave (40 days including local bank holidays) Company Socials (virtual or in person) Annual Global Offsite Plumm Health (mental health platform) You can find a more detailed explanation here and you might be eligible for other benefits depending on your location.
