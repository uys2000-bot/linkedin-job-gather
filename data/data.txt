2 --> Volunteer: Web Developer
VotingSmarter
Newport Beach, CA
VotingSmarter is a civic tech nonprofit. We are founded on the idea that in order to fight voter apathy, political corruption, misinformation and paralyzing partisanship we must address the incentives that cause them. That starts with "cheaper" and fairer information. Everything we do is centered on being fair, fast, and fun. Be began by fighting voter apathy in 2020. We built a "dating app for elections" that matched thousands of voters to the political candidates that matched their political preferences rather than political party or immutable characteristics like race, age, or gender identity.

Since the 2020 election, we’ve been designing a tool to fight the political corruption created by large corporate donations and lobbying. We are super excited to announce that after months of development and thousands of hours of research, our new Chrome extension that matches shoppers to the companies that donate to candidates that share their political values has been approved and is live in the Google Chrome Store!!!

Who We Are

Our team is made up of passionate people from all over the world, from all walks of life, and from all over the political spectrum. At VotingSmarter, we recognize that our political process is broken and that being an informed citizen is hard work; it takes too much time and emotional effort.

VotingSmarter’s 2020 "dating app for elections" turned 4000 hours of boring political research into 4 minutes of "fun".

VotingSmarter’s new Chrome extension turns countless hours of research into a tool for conscious consumerism. The businesses you shop at everyday use YOUR dollars to support THEIR values and political agendas. With the VotingSmarter browser extension, you can be sure your dollars are spent supporting YOUR values.

Join our team to help us combine these two great products into a new platform in both web2 AND web3 and give people their political power back.

We have an upcoming NFT drop and are starting to design a metaverse for politics. Leave your mark on the future of politics.

Who you are is just as important as (if not more important than!) what you can do.

You have experience with software development, most likely in languages like Python, C++, Go (golang), or something along those lines.
You can set up a project in GitHub, manage a README markdown file, and put triggers in place for automatically deploying branches to specific staging/production environments in your sleep.
You are a proactive leader and problem solver.
You’re naturally curious and strive to learn.
You’re a good colleague who cares about the well-being of your team members.
You work well on inter-team collaboration with product managers, software developers, data analysts, and account services.
You probably make comments at happy hour like, “DevOps is more than just a sys admin who talks to devs,” or, “Here are ten reasons why I’ll take z-shell over bash,” or possibly even, “Isn’t it weird that depending on what branch of Amazon you work for, ‘continuous delivery’ can mean two completely different things?”
If you go quiet on Slack, it’s probably because you are setting up automated unit tests with GitHub actions.

About The Role

Like you, this job is multidimensional. And every aspect is crucial to creating culturally relevant work.

Collaborate with team leadership to understand project requirements and plan the best way to exceed them.
Work with developers to create, manage, optimize, and integrate their development and deployment workflows.
Troubleshoot operation issues across multiple projects.
Develop solutions that can support large capacity and scale reliability
Create and monitor the CI/CD pipeline and respond to incidents.
Document everything.
Deploy product releases working with external tech teams or through our own systems.

Manage, oversee, and help grow our junior and mid-level tech team members.
Stay on top of the latest trends in our industry and suggest ways to keep Cheil an industry-leader.
Participate monthly as a contributing member in the Metaverse Standards Forum on behalf of Cheil.

About The Requirements

You’ve got to check the boxes before you can think outside of them.

Bachelor’s degree in a related field preferred.
3+ years’ professional experience with development infrastructure.
Skilled in AWS or similar package services.
Experience with GitHub/GitLab/Jenkins/Jira/Confluence, or similar services.
Networking experience.

About This Position

Social XR is about communication between people over distance as if you are in the same location. At TNO we are making Social XR as (photo) realistic as possible and seek for people to get involved and stretch the current boundaries of technology.

What will be your role?

At TNO, we create innovative media technologies aimed at providing people with new and rich media experiences, which they can enjoy wherever, whenever and with whomever they want. In the TNO MediaLab, we mainly develop streaming solutions on end-to-end communications, working from the capture side to the rendering side, such as coding, transport, synchronization, orchestration, digital rights management, and service delivery.

We are currently innovating and developing technical solutions to allow photo-realistic communication in eXtended Reality (XR) with the potential of transforming the everyday communication of people, especially in the context of the metaverse. We work on new forms of communication in virtual worlds that are currently not possible. Moreover, we design our systems to allow better communication across any distance in space, which has a direct impact on the life of tomorrow, and thereby create a more sustainable future. We take diversity and equity into our design considerations, such as the inclusion of the elderly and people with disabilities, allowing people to travel less and offer better access to knowledge and expertise. Thanks to our innovation, we break communication barriers.

The web is the future for VR and AR. Wonderland Engine is the matching developer platform.

Our product is the Wonderland Engine, a developer platform for VR, AR and 3D applications on the web. Applications developed with the Wonderland Engine run through a web browser and don't need to be installed on the respective target device first (e.g. the VR glasses). This makes development much faster. The applications can also be published directly via a web server without having to wait for confirmation from an app store.

Development speed is the decisive factor in realizing the potential of VR and AR. For this reason, we are convinced that web-based applications will play a crucial role in the future of the Internet. Our goal is to become the world's leading developer platform for web-based VR, AR and 3D applications.

64 --> Hardcore Degen at Crypto Start-Up
GOGO Protocol
Berlin, Berlin, Germany (Remote)
About 0VIX Protocol

Web 3.0 is the next wave of technology breakthroughs to revolutionize human society, with key pillars being decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, Metaverse, and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The space is growing at breakneck speed with enormous growth potential in years to come.

We originally came from the Metaverse with a trending top 15 NFT project on OpenSea called CryptoGOGOs that developed into GOGO Protocol, which is constructing the most user-friendly open source DeFi protocol for asset management and savings. The genesis came from the idea of merging the power of NFTs with a DeFi protocol that is as user-friendly as world-class FinTech apps. To further expand yield-generating opportunities for our users we realized that we lacked direct integration into a native money market. So we decided to build one from scratch.

The 0VIX Protocol is built by a global team of 35+ professionals, spread across 3 continents, with deep Crypto/DeFi expertise and with roots in banking, finance, tech, arts, entertainment, and gaming, as well as more than 10 years of experience in building multi-billion dollar tech companies such as N26, Consensys, Binance, Deutsche Bank and Sovryn.

In addition, you will be responsible for updating daily documentation listing the top yielding investment strategies across the major blockchains interfacing via DeFi, NFT and Metaverse plays. The daily investment operations commence with your insight and will be the source of numerous market reports and newsletters.
Conduct due diligence on crypto projects, including directly liaising with asset issuers.
Write internal reports that synthesize your learnings, working cross-functionally to educate various teams on all elements of the projects and program.

The next pivot for beamya will be into the metaverse. Bill Gates claims that most virtual interactions will move from 2D to 3D in the next 2-3 years. The challenge is to become the first market player for team building events in this new space. For such a pivot, we are searching for a CTO to complement our team skills.

Tasks
Product development: Envision how web3/metaverse could enhance the product; test and build/implement
Platform development and design: Ensure that the website is fully automated & UX-friendly
Fundraising: Network with potential investors, pitch to accelerators, VC's etc.
Other tasks could also include host management & sales

Requirements
Full-time commitment with no other side hustle, preferably
Passion for the web3/metaverse space and knowing the current market trends
Background in business informatics, machine learning, etc. or knowledge in building a platform/marketplace
Selfstarter with high motivation and proactive working approach
A people-person! Who likes to go all-in and is fully committed
Clever use of data & IT to optimise our product
At least 3 years working experience
Switzerland-based would be great

Benefits
Drive and develop a dynamic startup idea to a successful company
Be part of a highly motivated team with the option to remote working and a flexible work schedule
beamya is part of the Innosuisse coaching program
Fair amount of shares (vested). Please note that founders will not pay out any salary themselves.

The most important factor for us is to find someone, who is resilient enough to start an own company, who likes to take risks and is a nerdie about how the web will evolve. And who takes her/himself not too seriously.

Wil jij meewerken aan de toekomst op de bleeding edge van de nieuwste technologie maar ben je zelf niet zo technisch?
Lees dan snel deze vacature want mass-adoption heeft de beste mensen nodig en jij kan daar één van zijn!

De recruiters binnen Haystack People hebben meerdere jaren ervaring in het aantrekken van talent in de Software Development sector. Dit is al jaren lang een ontzettend schaarse markt en in Web3 gaat dit nog een stapje verder want de beste mensen zijn nodig om de toekomst te bouwen.

Bij Haystack People delen wij de visie en het gedachtegoed van Web3 en zijn we als team trots op wat we bijdragen door de teams te bouwen van de tools die de fundering zijn voor de toekomst.

En die kennis gaan we overbrengen op jou want in je eerste jaar wordt je opgeleid tot niet alleen een expert in Web3 recruitment, maar ook een recruiter op top-niveau. Je gaat dus echt een vak leren! Je ontwikkelt jezelf op het gebied van recruitment, headhunting, accountmanagement, business development en consultative selling. Je zult beginnen om te werken aan recruitment projecten voor onze bestaande klanten, geleidelijk groei je door en ga je jouw eigen klantportfolio ontwikkelen. Er liggen volop doorgroeimogelijkheden om een combinatie van recruitment, accountmanagement en sales te doen aan zowel de kandidaatzijde als de klantzijde, deze ambities worden sterk gestimuleerd.

In de eerste maand beginnen we met je training over software development (we snappen dat je daar misschien nog niets van weet). Daarna ga je zelf kandidaten spreken, ze begeleiden tijdens het proces maar de echt kunst zit in het bereiken van de kandidaten. Maar waar vind je die? In de Metaverse, of nou ja, een variant daarvan.

Op dagelijkse basis ben je voornamelijk bezig om je kandidaten- en klanten netwerk in de niche waarin je actief bent uit te breiden. Dit doe je door middel van het bijhouden van verschillende (social media) kanalen en databases, (personal) branding, talent sourcing, targeting & advertisement, referenties, headhunting en cold / warm calls. Dagelijks zul je, je netwerk uitbreiden via Linkedin, andere social media maar bijvoorbeeld ook via Discord. Web3 is een community en als je iets weet van Crypto dan weet je hoe belangrijk deze is. Jij zult je actief mengen in verschillende groepen en ook zo jouw eigen online-identiteit en merk gaan gebruiken om het juiste talent voor jouw partners aan te trekken. Maar dat doe je natuurlijk niet alleen!

Je collega's staan altijd paraat om vragen aan te stellen en helpen je graag en samen met jou maken we ook een plan om er voor te zorgen dat jij uiteindelijk op eigen benen kan staan in deze wereld. Niet alleen als recruiter, maar expert binnen jouw vakgebied.
Je start op een bruto salaris van €2300,- - €3000,- met daarbij een ongelimiteerd bonussysteem gebaseerd op plaatsingen die jij realiseert. Voor iedere plaatsing die je doet krijg je een bonus van €750-€1250 per plaatsing in het eerste jaar (je doet er een paar per maand). Je bonus groeit mee met jouw resultaten en senioriteit, zodat jouw bruto salaris flink oploopt bij ieder resultaat dat je boekt.
8% vakantiegeld, 25 vakantiedagen en een telefoon en laptop van de zaak.
Dedicated begeleiding van het management en senior recruiters. Zij zijn erop gefocust om het beste in jou naar boven te halen en je alle tools te bieden waarmee jij jezelf optimaal kunt ontwikkelen. Je werkt als jong talent dan ook heel intensief met hen samen, maar krijgt ook de vrijheid wanneer jij zelf je ding wilt doen.
Veel doorgroeimogelijkheden. Je komt terecht in een snelgroeiende start-up, wanneer jij ervoor open staat kun je heel snel stappen maken.
Ruimte voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling; zowel interne als externe trainingsmogelijkheden voor recruitment, sales, accountmanagement en management competenties.
Binnen ons bedrijf heerst geen 8-17 uur mentaliteit. We zetten graag allemaal een stapje extra om het beste in onszelf naar boven te halen. Gelijktijdig heb je zelf alle tools in handen om een voor jou passende werk-privé balans te creëren.
Je kunt gratis gebruik maken van een crypto adviseur die je kan helpen om je bonussen te beleggen
Functie-eisen
Je hebt een bedrijfskundige of commerciële achtergrond of kunt aantonen dat je minimaal hbo werk- en denkniveau hebt.
Je beheerst de Nederlandse en Engelse taal uitstekend in zowel woord als geschrift.
Inhoudelijke kennis van IT is niet nodig, dit leren we je. Interesse in de IT wereld vinden we wel belangrijk.
Je hebt aantoonbare ervaring of affiniteit met de saleswereld in de vorm van een bijbaan, stage of andere werkzaamheden. Ervaring met koude acquisitie is een pré.
Je hebt een rijbewijs en bent bereid op locatie te werken in Zwanenburg en bent 40u per week beschikbaar.
Je weet het verschil tussen BTC en ETH, een goede en een slechte NFT en je weet dat een DAO geen broodje is.
Je kan meepraten over onderwerpen als Smart Contracts, P2E games, Chains, Communities, Minten, NFT's. Diepgaande kennis is niet nodig maar je begrijpt de basis.
Je zit in Discords om je favoriete projecten te volgen.
Je hebt een winnaarsmentaliteit, bent gedreven en wilt dat alles dat jij aanraakt slaagt.
Je bent ambitieus en wilt zowel op persoonlijk als professioneel vlak stappen maken om jezelf te ontwikkelen.
Je bent een makkelijkere prater, kunt levelen met verschillende soorten mensen en weet goed de leiding de nemen in zakelijke gesprekken.

ConsenSys
Portugal (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team

Témoignage d'un(e) ancie(ne) stagiaire

Hello ! Je m’appelle Zoé, je travaille à Avanade depuis presque 1 an et demi maintenant. J’ai commencé en tant que stagiaire au sein de la Digital Factory le 1 er Mars 2021, dans le cadre de mon stage de fin d’études et ai poursuivi en CDI. Comme l’innovation et le champ de la recherche & du développement me tenaient à cœur, cette année j’ai eu l’opportunité de travailler à 40% en interne sur des sujets innovants et passionnants en intégrant le Tech Office. J’effectue donc deux activités en parallèle, à savoir ma mission chez le client (GRDF ?) et mes activités pour le Tech Office.

Quelles sont tes missions chez Avanade ?

Comme mentionné précédemment, j’exerce deux activités conjointement :

Chez mon client, j’ai développé un chatbot intégré dans Teams, en utilisant le Bot Framework SDK de Microsoft. L’objectif premier du bot est de répondre aux questions des collaborateurs sur les outils et services internes, et sur les outils de la suite Office 365, dans le cadre de la conduite du changement au sein de l’entreprise. Je travaille actuellement à le rendre plus « intelligent » en y incorporant des capacités cognitives de compréhension du langage – de l’IA – afin qu’il puisse gérer de multiple scénarios.
Au sein du Tech Office, j’ai eu l’occasion de travailler sur différents projets et d’explorer beaucoup de sujets innovants. J’ai commencé par travailler sur un démonstrateur centré autour de l’IoT industrielle et destiné à un salon auquel participe Avanade, appelé le SIDO. Le projet comporte différentes technologies telles que de « l’IA at Edge », de l’IoT, un digital twin, de la réalité mixte et virtuelle, de la robotique, du low-code, du traitement de data etc.

J’ai également aidé à la conception de l’Innovation Center dans les bureaux de Paris, en réfléchissant à l’offre destinée aux clients et aux collaborateurs d’Avanade, son format (les « Innovation Journey ») et son contenu (les démos, présentations etc.).

J’ai ensuite exploré le sujet du « Metaverse » en travaillant sur de la conception et de la modélisation 3D d’univers virtuels, pour finalement me focaliser sur les technologies de réalité étendue (AR, MR et VR) ainsi que la gestion de projet et d’équipe.

Qu’est-ce qui te plait dans tes missions ?

Ce qui me plait le plus c’est leur diversité, j’aime découvrir un nouveau sujet ou une nouvelle technologie. J’apprécie également la liberté et l’autonomie dont je dispose pour effectuer mes recherches et développer mes applications. Et évidemment, toutes ces expériences sont très enrichissantes tant sur le plan technique qu’interpersonnel.

Qu’est-ce qui te plait chez Avanade ?

Avoir l’opportunité de se former et de monter en compétence quel que soit son niveau est un vrai plus. J’ai également été touchée par la bienveillance et l’entraide entre les collaborateurs.

Comment as-tu découvert Avanade? Qu'est-ce qui t'as fait choisir Avanade?

J’ai découvert Avanade par l’entremise d’une amie de mon école d’ingénieur, qui été déjà en CDI lorsque je cherchais une entreprise pour effectuer mon stage de fin d’études. Ce qui m’a fait choisir Avanade c’est l’opportunité de formations, ainsi que les missions qu’on m’a présentées et sur lesquelles j’allais pouvoir intervenir.

Quelles ont été tes missions pendant le stage ?

Durant cette période j’ai également travaillé sur deux sujets en parallèle, le premier était le développement d’une double application mobile et bureau à l’aide de la PowerPlatform (technologie low-code/no-code), destinée à faciliter l’intégration et l’assimilation des connaissances acquises par les new joiners durant leurs onboarding, et prenant la forme d’un jeu en plusieurs parties. Lors de ce projet je suis passée par toutes les étapes du cycle de vie d’un projet, à savoir, l’analyse et le recueil des besoins, le POC, le chiffrage, l’écriture d’un backlog et la mise en place d’une méthodologie Agile, le développement, les tests, la mise en production et l’écriture d’une documentation.

Le deuxième projet était le développement d’une IA dans le cadre d’une application visant à apprendre la langue des signes en réalité mixte avec un casque HoloLens 2. Pour ce projet à caractère innovant, j’ai alterné entre phases de développement et recherche/lecture de papiers scientifiques.

Bulgaria (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter.

ConsenSys
France (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

232 --> Pre Sales Architect - Infura
ConsenSys
New Zealand (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

241 --> Pre Sales Architect - Infura
ConsenSys
Spain (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

256 --> Pre Sales Architect - Infura
ConsenSys
Italy (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

285 --> PhD Deep interactive control of virtual character's motion based on separating identity, motion and style
InterDigital, Inc.
Rennes, Brittany, France
About InterDigital

InterDigital develops fundamental wireless technologies that are at the core of mobile devices, networks, and services worldwide. We solve many of the industry's most critical and complex technical challenges, providing solutions for more efficient broadband networks and a richer multimedia experience years ahead of market deployment. InterDigital has strategic relationships with many of the world's leading wireless companies. Founded in 1972, InterDigital is listed on NASDAQ and is included in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index.

PhD topic: Deep interactive control of virtual character's motion based on separating identity, motion and style

Competencies

computer animation, deep learning

Description

Character animation has a large set of potential applications, in videogames, movie industry, sports, rehabilitation, ergonomics, training, etc. Most of the available tools to animate virtual humans consist in specifying angular trajectories for each joint of a skeleton. The surface mesh of the character is then computed accordingly, using so-called skinning algorithms. However, being able to capture and reproduce the expressivity of a human motion is difficult, as it involves several subtle parameters, some of them being lost when modeling human performance as joint angles: angles, contacts on the body surface, velocity profiles, accelerations, distance or coordination between body parts, etc. With the development of robust body shape reconstruction based on cheap sensors, such as RGB cameras or depth sensors,directly manipulating the visible surface of the character has become a very active field of research.

With the growing interest in persistent shared virtual worlds, such as the MetaVerse immersive social network, specific problems for character animation raised. Indeed, in these environments, the users are represented by avatars with different shape and morphology. The character animation platform should consequently be able to adapt the motion of the user to this different shape (retargetting problem), or adapt the identity of the avatar to make the user be recognizable by his/her friends, or change the style of the motion to convey a given emotion or adapt to the expecting behavior of the avatar. For example, a Hulk avatar is expecting to move with a specific style, but should also mimic the performance of the user. This PhD topic will investigate deep-learning methods to solve this retargeting problem while controlling the style.

Sujet de thèse : Contrôle interactif approfondi du mouvement du personnage virtuel basé sur la séparation de l'identité, du mouvement et du style

Compétences

Animation par ordinateur, apprentissage profond (deep learning)

Description

L'animation de personnages a un large éventail d'applications potentielles, dans les jeux vidéo, l'industrie cinématographique, le sport, la rééducation, l'ergonomie, la formation, etc. La plupart des outils disponibles pour animer des humains virtuels consiste à spécifier des trajectoires angulaires pour chaque articulation d'un squelette. Le maillage de la surface du personnage est ensuite calculé en conséquence, à l'aide d'algorithmes dits de « skinning ». Cependant, il est difficile de capturer et de reproduire l'expressivité d'un mouvement humain, car elle fait intervenir plusieurs paramètres subtils, dont certains sont perdus lors de la modélisation des performances humaines comme les angles des articulations : angles, contacts sur la surface du corps, profils de vitesse, accélérations, distance ou coordination entre les parties du corps, etc. Avec le développement d'une reconstruction robuste de la forme du corps basée sur des capteurs bon marché, tels que des caméras RVB ou des capteurs de profondeur, la manipulation directe de la surface visible du personnage est devenue un domaine de recherche très actif.

Avec l'intérêt croissant pour les mondes virtuels persistants et partagés, tels que le réseau social immersif MetaVerse, des problèmes spécifiques à l'animation de personnages se sont posés. En effet, dans ces environnements, les utilisateurs sont représentés par des avatars aux formes et morphologies différentes. La plateforme d'animation de personnages doit donc pouvoir adapter le mouvement de l'utilisateur à cette forme différente (problème de reciblage), ou adapter l'identité de l'avatar pour que l'utilisateur soit reconnaissable par ses amis, ou changer le style du mouvement pour transmettre une émotion donnée ou s'adapter au comportement attendu de l'avatar. Par exemple, on attend d'un avatar de Hulk qu'il se déplace avec un style spécifique, mais il doit aussi imiter la performance de l'utilisateur. Ce sujet de thèse étudiera les méthodes d'apprentissage profond pour résoudre ce problème de reciblage tout en contrôlant le style.

299 --> Pre Sales Architect - Infura
ConsenSys
Japan (Remote)
Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

Témoignage d'un(e) ancie(ne) stagiaire

Hello ! Je m’appelle Zoé, je travaille à Avanade depuis presque 1 an et demi maintenant. J’ai commencé en tant que stagiaire au sein de la Digital Factory le 1 er Mars 2021, dans le cadre de mon stage de fin d’études et ai poursuivi en CDI. Comme l’innovation et le champ de la recherche & du développement me tenaient à cœur, cette année j’ai eu l’opportunité de travailler à 40% en interne sur des sujets innovants et passionnants en intégrant le Tech Office. J’effectue donc deux activités en parallèle, à savoir ma mission chez le client (GRDF ?) et mes activités pour le Tech Office.

Quelles sont tes missions chez Avanade ?

Comme mentionné précédemment, j’exerce deux activités conjointement :

Chez mon client, j’ai développé un chatbot intégré dans Teams, en utilisant le Bot Framework SDK de Microsoft. L’objectif premier du bot est de répondre aux questions des collaborateurs sur les outils et services internes, et sur les outils de la suite Office 365, dans le cadre de la conduite du changement au sein de l’entreprise. Je travaille actuellement à le rendre plus « intelligent » en y incorporant des capacités cognitives de compréhension du langage – de l’IA – afin qu’il puisse gérer de multiple scénarios.
Au sein du Tech Office, j’ai eu l’occasion de travailler sur différents projets et d’explorer beaucoup de sujets innovants. J’ai commencé par travailler sur un démonstrateur centré autour de l’IoT industrielle et destiné à un salon auquel participe Avanade, appelé le SIDO. Le projet comporte différentes technologies telles que de « l’IA at Edge », de l’IoT, un digital twin, de la réalité mixte et virtuelle, de la robotique, du low-code, du traitement de data etc.

J’ai également aidé à la conception de l’Innovation Center dans les bureaux de Paris, en réfléchissant à l’offre destinée aux clients et aux collaborateurs d’Avanade, son format (les « Innovation Journey ») et son contenu (les démos, présentations etc.).

J’ai ensuite exploré le sujet du « Metaverse » en travaillant sur de la conception et de la modélisation 3D d’univers virtuels, pour finalement me focaliser sur les technologies de réalité étendue (AR, MR et VR) ainsi que la gestion de projet et d’équipe.

Qu’est-ce qui te plait dans tes missions ?

Ce qui me plait le plus c’est leur diversité, j’aime découvrir un nouveau sujet ou une nouvelle technologie. J’apprécie également la liberté et l’autonomie dont je dispose pour effectuer mes recherches et développer mes applications. Et évidemment, toutes ces expériences sont très enrichissantes tant sur le plan technique qu’interpersonnel.

Qu’est-ce qui te plait chez Avanade ?

Avoir l’opportunité de se former et de monter en compétence quel que soit son niveau est un vrai plus. J’ai également été touchée par la bienveillance et l’entraide entre les collaborateurs.

Comment as-tu découvert Avanade? Qu'est-ce qui t'as fait choisir Avanade?

J’ai découvert Avanade par l’entremise d’une amie de mon école d’ingénieur, qui été déjà en CDI lorsque je cherchais une entreprise pour effectuer mon stage de fin d’études. Ce qui m’a fait choisir Avanade c’est l’opportunité de formations, ainsi que les missions qu’on m’a présentées et sur lesquelles j’allais pouvoir intervenir.

Quelles ont été tes missions pendant le stage ?

Durant cette période j’ai également travaillé sur deux sujets en parallèle, le premier était le développement d’une double application mobile et bureau à l’aide de la PowerPlatform (technologie low-code/no-code), destinée à faciliter l’intégration et l’assimilation des connaissances acquises par les new joiners durant leurs onboarding, et prenant la forme d’un jeu en plusieurs parties. Lors de ce projet je suis passée par toutes les étapes du cycle de vie d’un projet, à savoir, l’analyse et le recueil des besoins, le POC, le chiffrage, l’écriture d’un backlog et la mise en place d’une méthodologie Agile, le développement, les tests, la mise en production et l’écriture d’une documentation.

Le deuxième projet était le développement d’une IA dans le cadre d’une application visant à apprendre la langue des signes en réalité mixte avec un casque HoloLens 2. Pour ce projet à caractère innovant, j’ai alterné entre phases de développement et recherche/lecture de papiers scientifiques.

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About DevU Sales

The DevU Sales team is focussed on driving repeatable sales for Infura and our developer products. Working with our executive team, marketing, product and services team, we drive the adoption of Infura in many core market segments (Defi / DAOs / Wallets, NFTs / Metaverse / Gaming, and Enterprise, financial services and Web2 companies) as well as through strategic partners, incubators, VCs, ISVs and system integrators. Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter.

480 --> Softwareentwickler C++ / Unreal Engine
viality AG
Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany (Hybrid)
WIR SUCHEN:
Softwareentwickler C++ / Unreal Engine (m/w/d)

Die Zukunft erschaffen – bei viality
Teaser: Gesucht wird ein (erfahrener) Unreal Entwickler mit C++ Kenntnissen zur langfristigen Unterstützung des viality Teams bei der Entwicklung von z.B. VR-Schulungs- und Simulationsanwendungen für B2C und B2A Kunden.

Über viality
Die viality AG wurde 2009 aus der Hochschule in Dortmund ausgegründet und hat sich seitdem zu einem der führenden Anbieter Deutschlands für Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Digital Twin und Metaverse Lösungen entwickelt. Dabei stehen vor allem Kunden aus Automotive und Industrie im Fokus, sowie Akteure des Handels und der öffentlichen Hand.
Innovation und Interdisziplinarität werden bei uns groß geschrieben. Denn nur durch das richtige Zusammenspiel von Entwicklern, Designern, Artists, Ingenieuren und Beratern können mehrwertstiftende Lösungen geschaffen werden, die für den Menschen funktionieren. Daher vereinen wir die klassischen Fähigkeiten eines Technologieunternehmens mit den Skills einer Konzept-Agentur und begleiten den Kunden auf Wunsch von der ersten Idee bis zum Go-Live.

Unsere Unternehmenskultur
Schon vor Corona waren flexibles Arbeiten z.B. durch Home Office oder flache Hierarchien bei uns alltäglich. Wir leben New Work. Doch manchmal erfordern Projekte auch die Tätigkeit vor Ort – entweder beim Kunden oder im viality Studio in Dortmund. Die Präsenz wird belohnt mit dem Zugang zu Spitzen-Hardware, freundlichen Kolleginnen und Kollegen und allen anderen für den Projekterfolg hilfreichen Kleinigkeiten.
Zudem leben wir Innovation. Unsere Arbeit ist geprägt von der ständigen Suche nach dem technisch machbaren. Oft erforschen wir neuste Ansätze und Technologien in Forschungsprojekten und übersetzen diese Erkenntnisse in mehrwertstiftende Angebote für die Wirtschaft. Entsprechend vereint uns alle die Neugier und Begeisterung für die Themen rund um VR, AR, Digital Twin, Metaverse. Daraus resultieren stets verschiedenste Projekte.

Aufgabenbereiche
Als (Senior) Unreal Developer (m/w/d) unterstützt du das Entwickler Team mit deiner Expertise rund um die Unreal Engine und C++ und bist für die Umsetzung und Erweiterung von Virtual Reality Schulungs- und Simulations-Anwendungen mit dieser Engine verantwortlich. Oftmals spielt die Anbindung von Sensorik oder individuellen Eingabegeräten dabei eine Rolle. Ziel ist es nutzerfreundliche und fehlerfreie Anwendungen zu schaffen und diese stets zu erweitern.
Neben der technischen Expertise in Soft- und Hardware sind auch Social Skills von hoher Bedeutung: Konzeptionell mitdenken, Technologien und Trends verständlich machen oder auch mal den Kunden mit beraten – dies sind alltägliche Aufgaben. Zudem freuen wir uns, wenn du dem viality Team neue Wege und Möglichkeiten aufzeigst und unsere Neugier stillst. 🙂

Dein Profil
(Abgeschlossenes) Studium der Informatik
Erfahrung im Coden mit C++
Erfahrung im Umgang mit der Unreal Engine
Englischkenntnisse wünschenswert
Gefühl für UI / UX wünschenswert
Erfahrung mit CryEngine / Unity von Vorteil
Erfahrung mit VR Entwicklung von Vorteil

Was wir bieten
Spannende, anspruchsvolle und abwechslungsreiche Tätigkeiten
Ein junges, dynamisches Team
Flexible Arbeitszeitgestaltung
Home Office möglich
Firmenhardware zur Privatnutzung
Team-Events
30 Tage Urlaub

Du findest dich wieder? Jetzt Bewerben!

Nineveh

In the Nineveh research team, we investigate cryptography developments to make Ethereum a better, safer and more private place. Some exemplary projects we are engaged in are:
Hybrid proof systems from SNARKs and STARKs. In this project, we combine techniques from SNARKs and STARKs to build hybrid proof systems enjoying the bests of both worlds. SNARKs allow for short (constant-size) proofs and have efficient verifiers, on the other had, they require trusted setup. zkSTARKs are transparent (don't rely on a trusted setup) and have efficient prover while paying the price of longer proof size (logarithmic to the size of the proven statement) and verifier's complexity. We investigate use of STARK-related primitives like FRI to give zkSNARKs more efficient provers and reduce security assumptions used. In the nearest future we plan to implement our hybrid schemes to show the world concrete efficiency gains our approach brings.
Secure storage for mnemonic keys. The common problem of using secret keys is that they may be stolen or lost, causing for example, losing access to staked funds. Here, we build an application that allows users to securely distribute the key into so-called shares such that only large enough set of the shares can be used to reconstruct the secret and someone who knows too few secret's shares learns nothing. We achieve that by using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. Importantly both the secret and the shares are represented by easy to remember mnemonic.
Security analysis of proof systems. In this project, we analyse security properties of existing zkSNARKs to verify whether they are sufficiently secure for such a complex environments that blockchains are. To that end, we use provable security methods. Additionally, we analyse existing zkSNARKs and name their security gaps. We show where efficiency-oriented efforts make proof systems unusable due to security vulnerabilities.
Towards more efficient and secure polynomial commitments. Polynomial commitment schemes are going to lay the ground for Ethereum's data availability in the future. Hence, one of our research task is to investigate novel polynomial commitment schemes that are better than Kate et al commitment scheme in terms of security and efficiency.
Towards more fair MEV. On of the potential security measure one can take to mitigate malicious MEV extraction attacks is by obfuscating submitted transactions. In this project, we investigate use of privacy preserving tools to assure more fair MEV.

Our team is looking for two kinds of people:
Cryptography enthusiasts who would enjoy analysing, breaking and designing cryptographic schemes.
Engineers with some background in cryptography who enjoy making proof of concepts of novel cryptographic protocols, extending cryptographic libraries, and finding vulnerabilities in existing implementations.

Skills that you will use and learn at the Nineveh research team include but not limited to:
basic algebra
cryptography -- provable security, cryptographic protocols (esp. zero-knowledge ones)
MEV
distributed systems
C++ / Rust / Python

Here's what some of our current interns have to say:

"I'm super excited with this opportunity to take part in such an important project and to work with a team of really talented people. Not only it gives me a chance to learn a lot but also, I'll be able to help in solving real world problems" Carmen Irene Cabrera Rodríguez, Cairo and Layer 2 Research Intern, Nubia team

"The Nethermind internship is like selling your soul to the devil. You don't know what you're getting yourself into at first, but by doing it you get some pretty rad powers with which to flex on mere mortals" Kristof Gazso, Ethereum and MEV Research Intern, MEV and Ethereum 1 team

Complementing our field sales team is the Presales Architect team, playing an instrumental in helping our prospects and customers achieve their success with our products.

What You Do

As a Pre-Sales Architect (Infura, Developers Tools & Infrastructure), you support product sale efforts by advising customers on ways to integrate Infura and other developer products with their tech stack.

While the role is not a sales quota-carrying role currently, the acquisition and retention of Infura customers are some of its main OKRs (objectives & key results).

Day-to-day, you participate in discovery and sales calls with Web3 companies, blockchain application builders, DeFi protocols and NFT platforms in order to articulate the benefits of the Infura product suite and identify ways to integrate these products into the customers' workflows.

Once a customer need has been identified, you drive the technical sales cycle with a high degree of autonomy, organizing technical workshops with customer stakeholders, delivering technical architectures and diagrams, demos, estimating the time and cost of integration steps, working with professional services and partners as needed, and delivering customer-ready technical proposals summarizing your findings and recommendations. You work closely with the Infura product team in order to understand how the current features and API endpoints, and product roadmap, may be relevant to the customer’s needs and drive feature requirements feedback.

You continuously learn about Ethereum technology, DeFi protocols, NFT innovations, DAOs and Wallets and ConsenSys product features, in order to be regarded as a world-class expert on decentralized application infrastructure on public blockchain networks.

The role is global in scope (Americas, EMEA, APAC). It mostly involves remote work, but occasional travel up to 30% of the time to attend customer meetings, conferences or hackathons may be involved.

Skills & Experience

Software engineer experience + at least 3+ years as solution architect / tech lead role at a tech company.
Experience in SaaS/ IaaS/ PaaS or API based products
Experience in creating technical and solutions architecture for simple and complex business problems
Experience in creating quick prototypes and demos for customers
Passionate about Ethereum/Web3 technologies and excellent knowledge of various L1/L2 Networks, NFTs, DeFi, Smart Contracts, etc
Hands-on experience of modern application architecture from conception, design, technology evaluation, pilot program, sizing, implementation, maintenance, and support.
Excellent customer-facing and communication skills (demos, workshops, public speaking, discussions with C-level and with developers)
Experienced in gathering, understanding and rationalizing customer business requirements.
Strong emotional intelligence and ability to work collaboratively with multiple stakeholders on multiple opportunities in a fast pace environment
Should be comfortable working as an independent contributor and as part of a team
Solutions Architect certification with any one of the cloud providers (AWS, Azure or Google) is a nice to have

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.

718 --> Software Developer VoIP (Go / Rust)
Element
Berlin, Berlin, Germany (Remote)
Who We Are

Element is the startup that employs the core team behind matrix.org— the leading project for secure, open decentralised communication.

Matrix’s mission is to make messaging as open as email — allowing everyone to choose where their data is hosted, enjoy private conversations thanks to advanced encryption, and ultimately be in control of their own communication.

Matrix powers Element, our flagship messaging apps for the web, iOS & Android, along with Element Matrix Services (EMS), our SaaS platform for personal & professional use.

We build things for everyone, and we know we can’t succeed without a diverse team. Our hiring process is designed to be humane and give candidates the best chance to show us what you can do. If we ever fall down on this, please let us know.

The Role

Element is heavily investing in building out Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC: providing an open and decentralised E2EE transport for negotiating media streams and data channels. On top, we have recently extended Matrix to support scalable decentralised E2EE group voice and video calling too (MSC3401). These are the base building blocks for visionary applications such as Element Call as well as the open metaverse (aka third room).

Similar to the concept of bridges between matrix and classical messenger applications, we are also aiming for bridging real-time media applications to connect to more legacy systems, e.g., SIP / PSTN, as we are trying to work on interoperability with a unified collaboration & communication vision. The VoIP team will be responsible for designing and implementing a Matrix MSC3401 compatible backend including a generic bridging model.

Currently Element Call cannot interop with other VoIP platforms. You’d come along to help evolve the backend and add one of the first bridges to interop with, e.g., SIP / PSTN, using a modern tech stack that ensures future compatibility.

Our VoIP team ensures that there is a communication layer for an open metaverse, so this is a great chance to make a big impact on the future of communication.

Since (almost) everything we do is open source you can get a great feel for exactly what it would be like to work on the team, come and say hi!

Requirements

As part of our VoIP Team you are fascinated by real-time audio and video processing. You enjoy exciting challenges and work scientifically on cutting-edge technologies. You will be responsible for developing audio / video infrastructure components and services. Your ideas and work will improve our real-time communication platform which is used by several million users per day.

The most important thing is that you believe passionately in the mission of decentralisation of the internet. More specifically that you believe that communications should not be centralised in the hands of a small number of very large organisations and instead individuals should control their own data and choose who they share it with.

Additionally we are looking for someone who is:
Smart, curious and enthusiastic
Likes to ship early and often
Likes to write tests :)
A tireless advocate of code quality (understanding the need for trade-offs in the short term whilst keeping us honest in the long term)
Enjoys working in an Agile / Lean development environment
Is articulate and empathetic.
Your experience

We don’t have hard requirements, we just want to build the best possible team, but as a bonus it would be great if some of the following are true.
Knowledge in real-time streaming of live-media (WebRTC)
Experience in legacy VoIP protocols like SIP
Knowledge of Linux, Docker
Experience maintaining and / or contributing to open source projects
Experience working in a continuous delivery environment
Ideally you worked with Go or Rust already

If you have any questions before making an application reach out to Adam (adamt@element.io).

Benefits

People tend to stay with the company for a long time, we take this as a sign that we have a cohesive, supportive culture, that we have engaging challenging work and that people can develop their skills and careers here for the long term. We also have a family friendly environment, many of the team have small children and we look to accommodate that as best we can. Since our technology is relevant to anything that requires real-time comms, the role provides exposure to a wide range of domains from web and app dev through to VR, VoIP and IoT.

Our package generally contains:
Private Health Insurance
Pension
Annual Bonus
Share Options
Home Office Allowance
Coworking Space Allowance
Annual leave (40 days including local bank holidays)
Company Socials (virtual or in person)
Annual Global Offsite
Plumm Health (mental health platform)

You can find a more detailed explanation here and you might be eligible for other benefits depending on your location.

Element does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.

Sommaire du poste

Chez KPMG, nous croyons que la réalité étendue est une nouvelle frontière qui exploite des technologies convergentes pour façonner l’univers virtuel du futur – un monde en 3D immersif et interconnecté dans lequel la réalité virtuelle, la réalité augmentée, l’intelligence artificielle, la chaîne de blocs et les cryptomonnaies redéfiniront notre façon de vivre, de travailler et de socialiser. Il s’agit d’une occasion exceptionnelle de rejoindre l’équipe Création du contenu de KPMG au Canada, qui connaît une croissance rapide, afin d’aider nos clients à franchir cette nouvelle frontière numérique qu’on appelle le métavers. Nous sommes à la recherche de pionniers passionnés pour aider nos clients à générer une valeur durable dans ce réseau émergent de réalité virtuelle qui transformera le commerce, l’expérience client et les communautés.

Il met à profit son expérience et ses compétences en communication narrative pour simplifier, à l’intention des hauts dirigeants, certains aspects plus complexes du métavers et du Web3 et proposer des stratégies qui favoriseront le succès des initiatives actuelles et futures de l’organisation.

Les candidats retenus nourrissent une véritable passion pour le métavers, les jetons non fongibles (NFT), la finance décentralisée et le Web3, combinée à une connaissance approfondie des pratiques institutionnelles du secteur.

Établir et entretenir des collaborations stratégiques avec des organisations externes afin de dégager des occasions concrètes dans ce domaine.

The web is the future for VR and AR. Wonderland Engine is the matching developer platform.

Our product is the Wonderland Engine, a developer platform for VR, AR and 3D applications on the web. Applications developed with the Wonderland Engine run through a web browser and don't need to be installed on the respective target device first (e.g. the VR glasses). This makes development much faster. The applications can also be published directly via a web server without having to wait for confirmation from an app store.

Development speed is the decisive factor in realizing the potential of VR and AR. For this reason, we are convinced that web-based applications will play a crucial role in the future of the Internet. Our goal is to become the world's leading developer platform for web-based VR, AR and 3D applications.

Sommaire du poste

Chez KPMG, nous croyons que la réalité étendue est une nouvelle frontière qui exploite des technologies convergentes pour façonner l’univers virtuel du futur – un monde en 3D immersif et interconnecté dans lequel la réalité virtuelle, la réalité augmentée, l’intelligence artificielle, la chaîne de blocs et les cryptomonnaies redéfiniront notre façon de vivre, de travailler et de socialiser.

Organiser des ateliers de formation stimulants et des démonstrations des plateformes virtuelles utilisées dans divers secteurs d’activité.
Établir et entretenir des collaborations stratégiques avec des organisations externes afin de dégager des occasions concrètes dans ce domaine.
Concevoir des événements numériques et des activités commerciales dans le métavers pour nos équipes, nos clients et nos collectivités; planifier, concevoir, animer et superviser la prestation de telles expériences.
Faire des recherches et développer du contenu qui informe et démontre notre clairvoyance et notre leadership éclairé, tant à l’interne qu’à l’externe.

Ce que vous apportez au rôle
Passion pour le métavers, les expériences de réalité augmentée/réalité virtuelle (RA/RV) et l’infrastructure technologique sous-jacente.
Présence active sur plusieurs plateformes virtuelles (Decentraland, The Sandbox, Horizon Worlds, Engage, Altspaces, etc.).
Connaissance de base des processus, des outils et des éléments constitutifs de la réalité étendue (RA/RV), du métavers, des NFT, du système d’économie de jetons et des portefeuilles de cryptomonnaies.
Bonne compréhension des tendances émergentes et des cas d’utilisation dans l’espace du Web3 et du métavers.
Au moins cinq ans d’expérience dans le développement commercial des technologies.

980 --> Site Reliability Engineer
DFINITY
Zurich, Switzerland (Hybrid)
The Internet Computer is the fastest and only infinitely scalable general-purpose blockchain — incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation in May 2021. A team of over 200 world renowned cryptographers, distributed systems engineers, and programming language experts have taken on the massive technological challenge of building, maintaining, and continuously improving a ‘world computer’ powerful enough to host Web3 dapps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects.

DFINITY was founded in 2016 by entrepreneur and crypto theoretician, Dominic Williams, and attracted interest and financial contributions from early members of the Ethereum community. Later, top-tier institutions such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, and SV Angel backed the Internet Computer in a collective effort to help build out Web3.

As the Site Reliability Engineering, you will be providing operational support for the Internet Computer components at the application layer. This includes on-going development of systems that monitor the Internet Computer’s health, corrective actions in case of incidents,.

Responsibilities:

Select, design, build, deploy, and maintain the services used to ensure high availability of DFINITY's product
Identify opportunities to automate or improve processes by writing code, and then write the code
Bake reliability and operability in to the product from the start, by participating in design and code reviews, identifying risks, problems, and mitigations
Work with other engineering and security teams to define processes that preserve the goals of the Internet Computer while remaining operationally feasible and automatable
Work with product owners to set SLOs, then implement SLOs in code and observability infrastructure
On-call for production services. 12/7 (on-call is split across two sites), roughly 1 week in 6. As issues may be caused by problems in wildly different areas of the code the chief responsibility is to coordinate the response to the issue and ensure it is resolved, pulling in engineers from other teams as necessary. On-call work is compensated with generous time off
This is not a team that exists to be on-call. This is a team that elects to be on-call because it helps do the job better. Being on-call makes it easier and more motivating to identify opportunities to reduce the number of alerts the system generates.
Operating, troubleshooting, and deploying software to Unix systems

Requirements:

Think about things in a systemic, methodical way, especially when troubleshooting
Know when "This is good enough for the next 12 months" is appropriate
Coordinate incident response across multiple teams -- clearly understanding and communicating what is going on, next steps, who is responsible for what, and so on
Write code. We use Rust -- you don't need to know Rust already, there'll be opportunities to learn, but experience designing and writing moderate sized applications (up to ~ 10Kloc) is necessary. Identifying opportunities to automate or improve processes by writing code, and then write the code to do it is key.

Within 1 month you will:

Understand DFINITY's infrastructure and production environment
Picked a suitable starter project
Submitted improvements to our documentation and process that you will have noticed during onboarding.

Within 3 months you will:
Have delivered the starter project
Shadowed other team members on-call, and be ready to join the on-call rotation from month 4 onwards
Pro-actively identified other improvements and proposed projects to deliver them

All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

Chez KPMG, nous croyons que la réalité étendue est une nouvelle frontière qui exploite des technologies convergentes pour façonner l’univers virtuel du futur – un monde en 3D immersif et interconnecté dans lequel la réalité virtuelle, la réalité augmentée, l’intelligence artificielle, la chaîne de blocs et les cryptomonnaies redéfiniront notre façon de vivre, de travailler et de socialiser.

Organiser des ateliers de formation stimulants et des démonstrations des plateformes virtuelles utilisées dans divers secteurs d’activité.
Établir et entretenir des collaborations stratégiques avec des organisations externes afin de dégager des occasions concrètes dans ce domaine.
Concevoir des événements numériques et des activités commerciales dans le métavers pour nos équipes, nos clients et nos collectivités; planifier, concevoir, animer et superviser la prestation de telles expériences.
Faire des recherches et développer du contenu qui informe et démontre notre clairvoyance et notre leadership éclairé, tant à l’interne qu’à l’externe.

Ce que vous apportez au rôle
